# This is a sample configuration file for your bot.  You will definitely
# want to edit this, to set up your bot.  Right now it creates a bot called
# "LamestBot" which sits on channel #lamest.
#
# more options can be found in files in doc/settings/
#
# IMPORTANT: Remember to make install and cd to the directory it created
# (~/eggdrop by default) before you continue, running the bot from
# eggdrop1.5/ will not work.
#
# PLEASE EDIT THIS FILE COMPLETELY! YOUR BOT WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY IF
# YOU DO NOT CONFIGURE IT CORRECTLY! WE CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!

# don't edit those 9 lines now!!
