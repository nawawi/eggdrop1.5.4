      <p><strong>The Party Line</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <p>The most important way you will communicate with your bot is through
    the party line. The party line is accessible via DCC chat or telnet.
    It&#39;s pretty much just a miniature lag-less IRC (see
    &quot;Botnet&quot; below), but it also consists of a console through
    which you can watch channel activity and give commands.</p>

    <p>To enter the party line, just offer a DCC chat to your bot. It should
    ask for your password if you&#39;ve set one. If you haven&#39;t set one,
    be sure to do so, so that you can use the /msg &quot;ident&quot; command
    and other goodies that require some sort of security.</p>

    <p>The party line is actually split up into 200,000 &quot;channels&quot;.
    The console is available from each channel, but you can only talk to
    people who are on your current channel (just like IRC). Channel 0 is the
    main party line, while others are typically reserved for private
    conversations. Channels 1-99,999 are botnet wide chat channels and any
    user joining that channel anywhere on the botnet will be able to chat
    with you, Channels *0-*99,999 are local bot-only channels, only people on
    the current bot you are on can chat to you on there channels.</p>

    <p>Commands for the console start with a dot (.), similar to the slash
    (/) used for IRC. At any time you can type <em> &quot;.help&quot;</em> to
    get a list of the possible commands. To find out what a command does, use
    <em> &quot;.help &lt;command&gt;&quot;</em> -- for example, <em>
    &quot;.help channel&quot;</em>. This documentation&#39;s appendix has the
    on-line help files for you to browse at your leisure.</p>

    <p>When you&#39;re on the party line, anything you type that doesn&#39;t
    start with a dot is considered to be broadcast to everyone else, just
    like talking on a channel. You can change channels with the <em>
    &quot;.chat&quot;</em> command or even leave all channels with <em>
    &quot;.chat off&quot;.</em></p>
