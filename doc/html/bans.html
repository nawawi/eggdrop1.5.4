      <p><strong>Bans And How They Work</strong></p>
    </div>
    <hr>

    <p>I assume that you know how bans work on IRC. Eggdrop handles bans and
    the 2 new modes, exemptions and invite in various ways, and this chapter
    is intended to help clarify how these modes are treated within the
    bot</p>

    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Ban Exemption modes</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This type of mode enables the person specified in the host mask
          to join the channel even if there is a ban in place matching their
          hostmask. Normally this is used if a domain ie. *.net is banned,
          and you want to enable someone from that domain to join i.e.
          *.friend.net. This list can only be viewed by channel ops.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Invite modes</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This type of mode enables the person specified in the hostmask
          to join a invite only channel without an invite.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>

    <p>From here on &#39;mode&#39; applies to all three modes (bans,
    exemptions and invites) unless otherwise specified. There are three types
    of modes, and two types of attribute that can be placed on a
    &#39;mode&#39;:</p>
    <hr>

    <p><strong>Types of &#39;modes&#39;</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>global modes</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>These modes will be active on every channel the bot monitors.
          Some will &quot;expire&quot; after a while (be removed
          automatically). Others are considered &quot;permanent&quot; and can
          only be removed by a master.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>channel-specific modes</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>These modes are active only on one channel, and are almost
          always temporary modes that expire after an hour or so (depending
          on how long you&#39;ve specified in the config file). Usually
          they&#39;re created by a Tcl script of some sort.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>non-bot modes</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>These are modes that were not placed by the bot, and that the
          bot doesn&#39;t care about. They can be removed by anyone on the
          channel. The other two types of modes are generally protected by
          the bot, and have to be removed via the bot.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>
    <hr>

    <p><strong>Attributes</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>unsticky modes</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>These modes are the style that Eggdrop sets by default, when a
          user uses one of the commands that results in a mode. This
          attribute means that the ban will be removed if using dynamic modes
          after a certain time. If a mode is <em>&quot;sticky&quot;</em> and
          you wish to set it to be unsticky, use the <em>
          &quot;.unstick&quot;</em> command.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>sticky modes</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>These modes are usually set by a user using the <em>
          &quot;.stick&quot;</em> command, modes with this attribute are
          attempted to be kept active on the channel by the bot, even if the
          channel is set to use dynamic modes. Obviously, if the channel
          isn&#39;t set to use dynamic modes, this won&#39;t have any
          effect.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>
    <hr>

    <p><strong>Behavior</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The different type of mode behave differently depending on the
      channel settings.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Bans</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If the channel is supporting dynamic bans then the ban is set
          when the user joins the channel otherwise the modes are permanently
          set. On a channel with dynamic bans the ban expires after ban-time
          minutes which is specified in the config file.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Exemptions</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If the channel is not supporting dynamic exempts then they are
          set the entire time. Otherwise the exemption is set when a ban is
          placed whose host includes that covered by the exemption. The
          exemption will remain in place for at least exempt-time minutes
          (defined in config file) or until after the corresponding ban has
          been removed, whichever is the longer.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Invites</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If the channel does not support dynamic invites then they are
          set permanently. Otherwise the invite is set when the channel is +i
          and a user requests an invite onto the channel. The invite then
          remains set for invite-time minutes (defined in config file) or
          until the channel goes -i again, whichever is the longer.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>
    <hr>

    <p>The party-line command <em>
    &quot;.+&lt;ban/exempt/invite&gt;&quot;</em> can add a global ban or
    channel specific ban depending on the parameters that are passed to it.
    <em>&quot;.kickban&quot;</em> will add a channel-specific ban. <em>
    &quot;.&lt;ban/exempt/invite&gt;s&quot;</em> will list them all,
    according to their category. Be sure to check out the help pages for
    those commands for more info.</p>
