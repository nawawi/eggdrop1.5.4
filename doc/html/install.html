    experience with Unix or Eggdrop, <strong> READ THE README FILE

    <blockquote>
      <p>Please, read the file <a href="readme.html">README</a> before
      attempting to set up this bot. It is <strong>NOT</strong> easy to use!
      This file is a quick setup guide, not a miracle worker. If you enter
      this file without basic Eggdrop knowledge, you will <strong>
      NOT</strong> leave with a working bot! Before asking ANY questions,
      <strong>READ THE README FILE OR YOU WILL BE BURNED TO A HORRIBLE DEATH!
      IF YOU DO NOT READ THAT FILE I WILL PERSONALLY WALK TO YOUR TERMINAL
      AND BEAT IT WITH A SMELLY SNEAKER!</strong> By the way, read <a href= 
      "readme.html">README</a>.</p>

    <p><a name="sect2"></a>2. <strong>Quick startup</strong></p>

    <p>Eggdrop uses the GNU auto configure scripts, to make things
    easier.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Type &#39;./configure&#39; from the Eggdrop directory. That
          script will determine how your system is set up, and figure out how
          to compile Eggdrop. It will also try to find Tcl, which is required
          to compile.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Type &#39;make&#39; from the Eggdrop directory. Or to force a
          statically linked module bot type &#39;make static&#39;. Otherwise
          the Makefile will determine which type of bot your system will
          support. Dynamic is always the better way to go if possible. There
          are also the options debug and sdebug (static-debug) which will
          give more detailed output on (a highly unlikely :) crash. This
          might help the devteam to track down the crash and fix the bug.
          Debug and sdebug will take a little longer to compile and will
          enlarge the binary a bit, but it&#39;s worth if you want to support
          Eggdrop development.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Eggdrop must be installed in a directory somewhere. This is
          accomplished by entering the Unix command:</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>make DEST=&quot;directory&quot; install<br>
           example make DEST=&quot;/home/egguser/eggdrop&quot; install<br>
           (note you must use full path for every file to be correctly
          installed) [The following is performed from the directory installed
          above]</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Copy the file &#39;eggdrop.conf.dist&#39; to a new file, usually
          the same name as the bot that will use it, e.g.
          &quot;Lamestbot&quot;.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Edit your config file Lamestbot completely.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Start the bot with the &quot;-m&quot; option to create a user
          file, ie &#39;eggdrop -m Lamestbot&#39;.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>When starting the bot in the future, drop the &quot;-m&quot;. If
          you have edited your bot script correctly, you can type:</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>chmod u+x &lt;my-bot-script-name&gt;<br>
           e.g.<br>
           chmod u+x Lamestbot</p>

          <p>and from then on, you will be able to run your bot directly from
          the script. So you can just type &quot;Lamestbot&quot; from your
          shell prompt to start up your bot. For this to work, the top line
          of your script MUST contain the correct path to the eggdrop
          binary.</p>
        </li>

        <li>It&#39;s advisable to run your bot via crontab so that it will
        automatically restart if the machine goes down or (heaven forbid) the
        bot should crash. Look at the file &#39;scripts/botchk&#39; and
        &#39;scripts/autobotchk&#39; for a great start with crontabbing the
        bot.</li>

        <li>Smile, and if you haven&#39;t already read the README file in its
        entirety, go take a long walk off a short pier.</li>
      </ol>

    <p><a name="sect3"></a>3. <strong>Modules</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>Modules are small pieces of code that can either be compiled into
        the binary or can be compiled separately in a file. This allows for a
        much smaller binary and a way of choosing which options you want
        installed in the bot. Before you compile the bot you can remove any
        *.mod directory in the src/mod that you don&#39;t wish to be
        compiled. Use caution though most of the modules that come with
        Eggdrop are required. The exception is woobie.mod and seen.mod. If
        you do not want these modules it is safe to delete those
        directories.</li>

        <li>If there are any personal modules that you have made or
        downloaded you can add them to the bot by placing them in the
        /src/mod directory with a mod extension. They will be automatically
        compiled during the make for you. They must have a valid make file
        and of course be compatible with the rest of the Eggdrop source.</li>

        <li>If you wish to add a module at a latter time follow the same
        steps in paragraph 2. After you have moved the appropriate files you
        will only need to type make modules to compile only the modules
        portion of the bot.</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect4"></a>4. <strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>What do I do if...?</li>

        <li>READ THE README FILE!</li>

        <li>The readme does not answer...!</li>

        <li>READ THE README FILE AGAIN!</li>

        <li>I still don&#39;t know how to...</li>

        <li>Well, go to <a href="http://www.egghelp.org/">www.egghelp.org</a>
        or <a href="http://www.eggheads.org/">www.eggheads.org</a> and see if
        you can find there what you&#39;re looking for. There&#39;re also
        lots of IRC help channels (usually #eggdrop) and various mailing
        lists. Try the <a href= 
        "http://scrambled.eggheads.org/mailman/listinfo/eggheads/"> Eggheads
        mailing list</a></li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This is the end. If you read to this point, hopefully you have also
    read the README file. If not, then READ IT!&amp;@#%@!</p>

    <p>Have fun with Eggdrop!</p>
