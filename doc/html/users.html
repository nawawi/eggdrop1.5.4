    <p>People on IRC are recognized by the bot according to their user@host.
    That is, if I am on IRC as:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><em>*** [Kirk] is ikaney@uk.defiant.org (Fortune favors the
      bold.)</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>then Eggdrop will identify me according to
    &quot;ikaney@uk.defiant.org&quot; and not by my nickname. I can change
    nicknames at will and it won&#39;t forget me.</p>

    <p>For convenience, it&#39;s useful to have a &quot;handle&quot; which
    always identifies the same person. Usually the &quot;handle&quot; is just
    whatever nickname some- one was using when the bot first learned them.
    The nickname you had when you first said &quot;hello&quot; to Eggdrop is
    the handle it will know you by, regardless of whatever nickname you may
    be using at a given time.</p>

    <p>Because of this, only one person can have a given handle on your bot.
    Masters can change it, and anyone with party-line access can change their
    own handle, but it&#39;s intended to be something stable -- unlike
    nicknames on IRC which are about as stable as Jello.</p>

    <p>Eggdrop likes to store a lot of information about each user. The most
    important thing stored is the list of hostmasks that a user is recognized
    by. You can add a new hostmask with the /msg &quot;ident&quot; command.
    Masters can add and remove hostmasks with the party-line commands
    &quot;.adduser&quot;, &quot;.+host&quot;, and &quot;.-host&quot;.</p>

    <p>Other things that are stored include the user&#39;s flags (see <a
    href="flags.html">Flags</a> section), the last time he/she was on a
    channel, an optional comment, their current directory in the file area,
    an info line which can be displayed when they join a channel, and
    possibly even some other things that Tcl scripts store.</p>
