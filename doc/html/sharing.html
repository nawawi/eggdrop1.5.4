      <p><strong>Userfile Sharing</strong></p>
    </div>

    <p>One of the more interesting things you can do when you link two bots,
    is to make them share userfiles. <strong>BE CAREFUL</strong> before you
    do this, though! When you link, one bot is going to lose its userfile!
    (It will be overwritten by the other bot&#39;s userfile.)</p>

    <p>To do userfile sharing, you have to make sure the share module and
    transfer modules are loaded. Otherwise, your bot will automatically
    reject all userfile share attempts by other bots. (It&#39;s a safety
    feature.)</p>

    <p>Next you need to decide which bot will be ACTIVE and which will be
    PASSIVE, the ACTIVE bot will send its userfile and overwrite the
    PASSIVE&#39;s userfile, so be careful. Once you&#39;ve decided, on the
    ACTIVE bot, you set the PASSIVE bot +s, to indicate sharing, and on the
    PASSIVE you set the ACTIVE +p to indicate passive sharing, the bot will
    only share passively with 1 bot at once, but can share actively with any
    number of bots.</p>

    <p>Next go through all the channels you want shared between the 2 bots
    and make sure they are +shared in the config file, and also that each bot
    has the other bot make +s for each channel,</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><em>e.g. on bot1: .botattr bot2 |+s #channel</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>When two sharing bots first connect, they will transfer the userfile.
    After that, when something in the user records changes, the info will be
    passed to the other share bot(s) so that as long as they are linked, they
    will stay in sync.</p>

    <p>By default, if two sharing bots get disconnected, when they reconnect
    the userfile will be completely transferred again. However, there is an
    option to use resync buffers. Resync buffers work by when the two sharing
    bots get disconnected, they start up resync buffers for each other. If
    they are reconnected within 15 minutes <em> (default)</em>, they can
    resync from the buffers they have held, and not have to re-download the
    userfile.</p>

    <p><strong> *WARNING* - The resync option may not work
    reliably.</strong></p>

    <p>You can mark a bot both +s and +a (share user files, but only link as
    an alternate). This is very odd and should probably only be used as a
    backup when you have a lot of bots sharing to one central hub. Only
    people who really know what they&#39;re doing should try marking a bot +s
    and +a.</p>
