4.8) For advanced users: If you compiled the bot using the debug or
     sdebug options and it dumped a 'core' file when it crashed,
     it would be *very* useful if you could paste gdb's output during
     the following steps:
     First call gdb
         $ gdb eggdrop -c core
     and then enter 'bt' on gdb's command line:
         (gdb) bt
     Keep your core file for at least one week, so that the dev team
     can ask for further information if needed.
