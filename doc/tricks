Some little tricks that you may or may not know about...

*  You can "lock" a user's info line by putting a '@' as the first letter.
   They won't be able to change it any more.

*  '.status all' will dump out virtually everything you have configured on
   your bot

*  TCL has a command 'info body <proc>' that will list the contents of a
   proc.  'info args <proc>' shows what you have defined as the parameters
   for the proc.

*  You can rename a builtin command by binding over it.  To rename '.status'
   to '.report', you'd do:
     unbind dcc - status *dcc:status
     bind dcc m report *dcc:status
   The first line removes the builtin binding on '.status', and the second
   line binds '.report' to the builtin status function.  Other built-in command
   examples include:
     unbind msg - status *msg:status
     bind msg m report *msg:status
   and:
     unbind fil - share *fil:share
     bind fil m link *fil:share

*  You can unlink all bots and clear out the botnet info from memory by
   using '.unlink *'.  It erases all channel assoc's and everything.

*  You can automagically make a ban sticky by adding a * as the first
   character in the ban reason.

*  You can add a user with a static hostmask when using .adduser by prefixing
   their nick by !. 
	ie with a hostmask of drummer!ident@some.host.com
		.adduser drummer
			uses *!ident@*.host.com
		.adduser !drummer
			uses *!ident@some.host.com

* If you don't want your logfiles to be deleted after two days and 
  don't want the bot to create a new logfile each new day, then set 
  'keep-all-logs' to 0 and 'switch-logfiles-at' to 2500 in your bot 
  config file to make it keeping one logfile all the time. However this 
  is not recommended on high traffic channels.

* You can modify eggdrops output in partyline, kick msg and other texts by
  editing core.english.lang in the language directory.
