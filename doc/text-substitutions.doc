###### MOTD ######

The MOTD (mesasge Of The Day) file is displayed everytime a user opens
a dcc chat or telnet session with the bot (so it shouldn't be TOO long).

There are a few %-variables you can insert into the motd, which will
be interpreted by eggdrop:

 %b   display bold
 %v   display inverse
 %_   display underline
 %f   display flashing via telnet, bold underline via irc
 %B   bot's nickname (ie, "LamestBot")
 %V   current eggdrop version (ie, "eggdrop v1.5.3+typodoc")
 %E   long form of %V (ie, "Eggdrop v1.5.3+typodoc  (c)1997 Robey Pointer (c)1999, 2000  Eggheads")
 %C   channels the bot is on (ie, "#lamest, #botnetcentral")
 %A   whatever is set in 'admin' (see 'set admin')
 %T   the current time (ie, "15:00")
 %N   the current user's nickname (ie, "Robey")
 %U   the current operating system the bot is on
 %%   a percent sign ("%")

You can also encode messages which can only be read by people
with certain flags:

 %{+m}Only masters would see this.%{-}
 %{+1}Only people with user flag #1 see this.%{-}
 %{+b}This is only displayed to users doing a remote '.motd'
 from another bot.%{-}
 %{+|m}Only channel masters would see this.%{-}
 Other extended % commands are:
 %{cols=N}     start splitting output into N columns
 %{cols=N/W}   same, but use a screen width of W
 %{end}        end columnated or restricted (ie %{+m}) block
 %{centre}     center the following text (70 columns)
