|Eggdrop Config File Settings Documentation|
--------------------------------------------

This file describes syntax and all settings for your eggdrop configuration
file. Please note, that you don't need to set all those var to make your
bot work properly.



##### EGGDROP CORE SETTINGS #####


The first line in eggdrop configuration file should contain a full qualified
path to eggdrop executable. It has to be implemented in the way the example
shows to make the config file work as a shell script

Example: 

#! /path/to/eggdrop


##### BASIC STUFF #####

You can change the basic eggdrop appearence and behaviour in this section.


set username "lamest"
    This setting defines the username the bot uses.
    Note that his setting is working only if no ident daemon is running on
    the machine your bot is on


set admin "Lamer <email: lamer@lamest.lame.org>"
    This setting defines which contact person should be shown in .status,
    /msg help and other places. You really should include this info.


set network "SomeIrcNetwork"
    This setting is used only for info to share with others on your botnet


set timezone "EST"
    This setting defines the timezone is your bot in. It's used for internal
    routines as well as for logfile timestamping or scripting purposes.
    The timezone string specifies the name of the timezone and must be three
    or more alphabetic characters.
    ex. Central European Time(UTC+1) could be "CET"


set offset "5"
    offset specifies the time value to be added to the local time to get
    Coordinated Universal Time (UTC aka GMT). The offset is positive if the
    local timezone is west of the Prime Meridian and negative if it is east.
    The value(hours) must be between 0 and 24
    ex. if the timezone is UTC+1 the offset is -1


set env(TZ) "$timezone $offset" (disabled by default)
    If you dont want to use the timezone setting for scripting purpose only
    but instead everywhere possible then use this setting.


addlang "english"
    if you want to have your eggdrop messages displayed in another language
    change the below command to match your preferences. An alternative would
    be to set the environment variabel EGG_LANG to that value.



##### LOG FILES #####

Eggdrop is capable of logging various stuff, from channel chatter to
commands people use on the bot or file transfers.

Logfiles are kept normaly for 24 hours. Afterwards they'll be renamed
to "(logfilename).yesterday". After 48 hours they'll get overwritten by the
logfile of the next day.


set max-logs 5
    maximum number of logfiles to allow - this can be increased if needed
    (don't decrease this)


set max-logsize 0
    maximum size of your logfiles, set this to 0 to disable.
    This value is in KiloBytes, so '550' would mean cycle logs when it
    reaches the size of 550 KiloBytes.
    Note that this only works if you have keep-all-logs 0 (OFF)


set quick-logs 0
    Defaultly eggdrop writes every 5 minutes its logfiles to disk. You can
    change this behaviour by turning this setting to 1 (ON). Eggdrop will
    write and check the logfiles for size every minute.
    Note that this setting might increase the cpu usage of your bot (on the
    other hand it will decrease your mem usage)


logfile <logflags> <channel> "logs/logfile"
    This setting actually tells the bot what should be loged from where in
    which file. (duh!).

    The most common log file flags are:
      m  private msgs/ctcps to the bot
      k  kicks, bans, mode changes on the channel
      j  joins, parts, netsplits on the channel
      p  public chatter on the channel
      s  server connects/disconnects/notices
      b  information about bot linking and userfile sharing
      c  commands people use (via msg or dcc)
      x  file transfers and file-area commands
      r  (if use-console-r enabled) EVERYTHING sent to the bot by the server
      o  other: misc info, errors -- IMPORTANT STUFF
      w  wallops: msgs between IRCops (be sure to set the bot +w in init-server)
    There are others, but you probably shouldnt log them, it'd be
    rather unethical ;). There are also five user-defined levels ('1'..'5') which
    are used by Tcl scripts.

    Each logfile belongs to a certain channel. Events of type 'k', 'j', and 'p'
    are logged to whatever channel they happened on. Most other events are
    currently logged to every channel. You can make a logfile belong to all
    channels by assigning it to channel "*". 

    Examples:

    logfile mco * "logs/eggdrop.log"
    logfile jpk #lamest "logs/lamest.log"

    In 'eggdrop.log' put private msgs/ctcps, commands, misc info, and errors
    from any channel
    In 'lame.log' put joins, parts, kicks, bans, public chatter and mode changes
    from #lamest


set log-time 1
    Use this feature to timestamp entries in the log file.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set keep-all-logs 0
    If you want to keep your logfiles forever turn this setting on. All
    logfiles will get suffix ".[day, 2 digits][month, 3 letters][year, 4 digits]"
    Note that your quota might get full by this, so check your logfiles often and
    download them.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set switch-logfiles-at 300
    You can specify in this setting, when eggdrop should switch the logfiles
    and started fresh.
    You have to use military time in here. 300 is default and describes 00:00.
    Note that a leading 0 will make Tcl think this is an octal value,
    something you probably don't want.


set quiet-save 0
    Those nasty "Writing user file..." and "Writing channel file ..." messages
    wont be logged anymore if this option is enabled.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set logfile-suffix ".%d%b%Y"
    If keep-all-logs is 1, this setting will define the suffix of the logfiles.
    The default will result in a suffix like "04May2000". "%Y%m%d" will produce
    the often used yyyymmdd format. Read the strtime manpages for more options.
    NOTE: On systems which don't support strftime, the default format will
    be used _always_.


##### FILES AND DIRECTORIES #####

set userfile "LamestBot.user"
    Specify here how your userfile should be called


set sort-users 0
    If  you want your userfile to be sorted on save, turn this feature on.
    Note that this takes a bit more cpu
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set help-path "help/"
    Specify here where eggdrop should look for help files.
    Don't modify this setting until you know what you're doing!


set temp-path "/tmp"
    Set here a place to store temporarily files


set motd "text/motd"
    The MOTD (motto of the day) is displayed when people dcc chat or telnet
    to the bot.
    Look into doc/settings.motd or type '.help set motd' in DCC CHAT or
    telnet connection for options.


set telnet-banner "text/banner"
    This banner will be displayed on telnet connections


set userfile-perm 0600
    Specifies what permissions the user, channel and notes (if notes module
    is loaded) files should be set to.
    The octal values are the same as for the chmod system command.

    To remind you:

           u  g  o           u  g  o           u  g  o
     0600  rw-------   0400  r--------   0200  -w-------    u - user
     0660  rw-rw----   0440  r--r-----   0220  -w--w----    g - group
     0666  rw-rw-rw-   0444  r--r--r--   0222  -w--w--w-    o - others

    Note that the default 0600 is the most secure one and should only be
    changed if you need your files for shell scripting or other external
    applications.


set mod-path "modules/"
    This path specifies the path were eggdrop should look for its modules



##### BOTNET, DCC AND NETWORK #####

Settings in this section should be unimportant fur you until you deal
with botnets (multiple eggdrops conected together to maximize efficency).
You should read doc/BOTNET before modifying these settings.


set botnet-nick "LlamaBot" (disabled by default)
    If you want to use a differnt nickname on the botnet than you use on
    IRC (i.e. if you're in an untrusted botnet) set it here.


listen <port> <mode>
    The listen command opens a telnet port by which you or other bots can
    interact with the eggdrop by telneting in.

    Valid ports are (as long as you aren't root) >1024.
    Valid modes are 'all', 'bots' and 'users'. You can assign special ports
    for users and bots, or one for all.

    Examples:

    listen 3333 bots
    listen 4444 users

    or:

    listen 3333 all

    There are more options for the listen command in doc/tcl-commands.doc
    Note, if you are running more than one bot on the same machine, you will
    want to space the telnet ports at LEAST 5 apart... 10 is even better


set remote-boots 2
    This setting defines if people can boot users on the eggdrop from other
    bots in your botnet. Valid settings are:
     0 - allow *no* outside boots
     1 - allow boots from sharebots
     2 - allow any boots


set share-unlinks 1
    This setting prohibits eggdrop to unlink from share bots if an remote bots
    tells so.


set telnet-flood 5:60
    Define here how many telnet connection attempt in how many seconds from
    the same host constitute a flood.
    Attempts:Seconds


set paranoid-telnet-flood 1
    If you telnet-flood to apply even to +f users, set this setting to 1
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set open-telnets 0
    If you want people allow to telnet in and type 'NEW' to become a new user,
    set this to 1. This is similar to 'hello'
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set protect-telnet 0
    This setting will drop telnet connections not matching a known host. It
    greatly improves protection from IRCOPs, but makes it impossible for NOIRC
    bots to add hosts or have NEW as a valid login.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set stealth-telnets 0
    If you don't want eggdrop to identify itself on a telnet connection, set
    this setting to 1. Eggdrop will display its nickname instead.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set use-telnet-banner 0
    If you want eggdrop to display a banner when telneting in set this setting
    to 1. The telnet banner is set by 'telnet-banner'.


set dcc-sanitycheck 1
    This setting will make the bot ignore DCC chat requests which appear to
    have bogus information on the grounds that the user may have been trying
    to make the bot connect to somewhere that will get it into trouble, or
    that the user has a broken client (like mIRC tends to do), in which case
    the connect wouldn't work anyway.  It's suggested that you turn this on.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set quiet-reject 1
    If turned to 1, the bot will squelch the error message when rejecting a
    DCC CHAT or SEND.
    Normally eggdrop tells the DCC user that the CHAT or SEND has been
    rejected because they don't have access, but sometimes IRC server
    operators detect bots that way.


set max-dcc 50
    Set here the maximum number of dcc connections you will allow - you can
    increase this later, but never decrease it.


set require-p 0
    Define here if +o user still need the +p flag to dcc the bot.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set dcc-flood-thr 3
    Specify here the number of lines from a user on the partyline (dcc, telnet)
    before they are considered to be flooding (and therefore get booted)


set resolve-timeout 15
    Set here the amount of seconds before giving up on hostname/address
    lookup. (you might want to increase this if you are on a slow network).


set ident-timeout 5
    Set a timeout in seconds how long to wait on ident-lookups


set connect-timeout 15
    This settings defines a timeout in seconds how long the bot should wait for
    a dcc chat, telnet, relay, etc connection.


set my-hostname "virtual.host.com"
set my-ip "99.99.0.0"
    If you're using virtual hosting (your machine has more than 1 IP), you
    may want to specify the particular IP to bind to. You can specify either
    by hostname or by IP. You may also want to set the hostname here if
    eggdrop has trouble detecting it when it starts up.


set firewall "host:port"
    Set this to your socks host if your eggdrop sits behind a firewall

    Example:

    set firewall "proxy:178"
    
    If you use a Sun "telnet passthru" firewall, use this setting:

    Example:

    set firewall "!sun-barr.ebay:3666"


set nat-ip "127.0.0.1"
    If you have a NAT firewall (you box has an IP in one of the following
    ranges: 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255, 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255,
    10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255 and your firewall transparently changes your
    address to a unique address for your box.) or you have IP masquerading
    between you and the rest of the world, and /dcc chat,/ctcp chat or
    userfile shareing aren't working. Enter your outside IP here.
    Do not enter anything for my-ip or my-hostname if you use this setting.


set reserved-port 9076
    If you want all your dcc connections bound to one specific port, set
    it here.
    Note that this setting limits your dcc connections to pretty one at time.


set dcc-portrange 1024:65535
    This setting is so that people can't send fake ports to your bot when
    they try to dcc it. irc clients should never use a port below 1024 and
    well 65535 is the highest port possible. this setting is used for telnet
    too.


set dupwait-timeout 5
    If your eggdrop rejects bots that actually have already disconnected from
    another hub, but the disconnect information has not yet spread over the
    botnet due to lag, use this setting.
    The bot will wait dupwait-timeout seconds before it checks again and then
    finally reject the bot.



##### CONSOLE #####

set console "mkcobxs"
    This is the default console mode. It uses the same event flags as the log
    files do.
    Note that the console channel is automatically set to your "primary" channel
    (the one you defined first in config file)
    Masters can change their console channel and modes with the '.console' command



##### COMMON STUFF #####

set ignore-time 15
    Set the time in minutes how long temp. ignores should last


set hourly-updates 00
    Define here what eggdrop calls 'hourly'. All calls to it, including such things
    as note notifying or userfile saving are affected by this.

    Example:

    set hourly-updates 15

    Bot will save 15 minutes past every hour its userfile


set owner "MrLame, MrsLame"
    Put all permanent owner into this variable


set default-flags "hp"
    Enter all flags that new users should get as a default.


set whois-fields "url birthday"
    Enter all user-defined fields that should be displayed in a '.whois'
    This will only be shown if the user has one of these xtra fields.
    You might prefer to comment this out and use the userinfo1.0.tcl script
    which provides commands for changing all of these.


set die-on-sighup 0
    Enable this setting if you want your eggdrop on receiving a SIGHUP.
    Otherwise eggdrop will just rehash.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set die-on-sigterm 0
    Enable this setting if you want your eggdrop on receiving a SIGTERM.
    Otherwise eggdrop will just save its userfile.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set must-be-owner 0
    If you enable this setting, only permanent owners (owner setting) will be
    able to use .tcl and .set
    moreover if you want only let permanent owners use .dump, then set it to 2
    Valid settings are 0, 1 and 2


set enable-simul 1
    Enable this setting, if you want to enable the 'dccsimul' tcl command
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set allow-dk-cmds 1
    Enable this setting, if you want +d & +k users to use commands bound as -|-
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


##### MODULES #####

After those core settings you should start loading up any modules. Modules are
loaded by the command "loadmodule module". Eggdrop looks for modules in the
directory you specified by the module-path setting in the path section.
Documentation and a list of all modules can be found in doc/modules directory

Please note, that for different configurations different modules are needed.
Four examples:

- Channel Security Bot

- Public IRC Bot

- Secure Filesys Bot

- Limbo Bot

Channel Security Bot:
This bot needs channel, console, dns, irc and if you like ctcp module loaded.
More is not needed and makes the bot slower.

Public Bot:
A public bot should have all modules available loaded since they provide all
functions for everybody.

Secure Filesys Bot:
This bot needs all normal irc operating modules but not notes, seen, ctcp or
share module.

Limbo Bot:
A limbo bot (bot serves as a botnet hub outside irc) just needs channels, console,
dns and maybe notes or share module loaded. Of course blowfist needs to be loaded
here, too.



##### SCRIPTS #####

Script section should be placed at the end of the config file. All modules should be
loaded and their variables should be set at this point.


source scripts/script.tcl
    This line loads script.tcl in the scripts directory of your eggdrop. All
    script should be put there, although you can place them where you like as
    long as you can supply a fully qualified path to them.

    Some commonly loaded scripts are alltools.tcl and action.fix.tcl. The
    aproperiate source lines are looking so:

    source scripts/alltools.tcl
    source scripts/action.fix.tcl
