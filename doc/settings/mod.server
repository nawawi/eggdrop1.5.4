##### SERVER MODULE #####

This module provides the core server support. You have to load this
if you want your bot to come on irc.

Put this line into your eggdrop configuration file file to load server module:

loadmodule server


There are also some variables you can to set in your config file:

set net-type 0
    Define here the network you use. There are six settings:
     0 = Efnet (non +e/+I hybrid)
     1 = IRCnet
     2 = Undernet
     3 = Dalnet
     4 = Efnet +e/+I hybrid
     5 = Others
    Valid settings are 0-5


set nick "LamestBot"
    Set here the nick of the bot, that which it uses on IRC, and
    on the botnet unless you specify a sperate botnet-nick


set altnick "L?m?stB?t"
    Set here an alternative nick to use if the nick specified by 'nick'
    is unavailable. All '?' characters will be replaced by a random number.


set keep-nick 1
    This setting makes the bot try to get his original nickname back (for
    example, if the intended nickname is already in use).


set realname "/msg LamestBot hello"
    Set here what to display in the real-name field for the bot


set init-server { putserv "MODE $botnick +i-ws" }
    Set here a script to run (if any) when first connecting to a server


set servers { IRCSERVER1:PORT IRSERVER2:PORT ... }
    Set here the list of irc servers you want your bot to connect to. You can
    add an optional port for the server.

    Example:

     set servers {
       irc.netw.ork
       irc.krow.ten:6668
     }

    This will make the bot connect on startup to irc.netw.ork using
    'default-port'. On deconnect or a '.jump' it will try to connect
    to irc.kwor.ten on port 6668.


set default-port 6667
    Set the default port which should be used if no one is specified at
    '.jump' or in 'server'


set strict-servernames 0
    Often irc server call themself in another way then there dns is. If
    you want eggdrop to replace your entry in the config file with this
    name, set this to 1. If you turn this setting to 0, eggdrop will keep
    a seperate list of the names irc servers call themselves
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.

set server-cycle-wait 60
    This setting defines how long eggdrop should wait before moving from one
    server to another on disconnect.
    If you set 0 here, eggdrop wont wait at all and connect instantly.
    Please note, that a too low setting could result in k-line for your host,
    since many ircops don't like being flooded with connects.
    Valid settings are 0-infinite

set never-give-up 1
    This settings makes the bot cycle forever and keep trying to connect to
    all irc servers in it's current list if they're down.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set server-timeout 15
    Set here the timeout how long eggdrop should wait for a response when
    connecting to a server before giving up and moving on to next server
    in list.


set servlimit 0
    If the number of servers on the net gets below this number, it will
    jump to a new server (ie, it will assume it's on the losing end of
    a netsplit) -- set to 0 to turn off
    Note that most irc networks use Time Stamping or Nick Delay now, so
    it's to your advantage to turn this off.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set check-stoned 1
    Set this to 1 if eggdrop should check for stoned servers? (i.e.
    Where the server connection has died, but eggdrop hasn't been
    notified yet).
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set serverror-quit 1
    If you want your bot to exit the server if it receives a error msg set
    this to 1
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set use-ison 1
    This setting makes the bot not u se /trace but /ison to check if our
    botnick is free or being used.
    Please note: some irc admins, look for excessive use of /trace
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set max-queue-msg 300
    Set here the maximum number of lines to queue to the server. If you're
    going to dump large chunks of text to people over irc, you will probably
    want to raise this -- most people are fine at 300 though


set use-console-r 0
    This setting allows you the logging of all information got from a server,
    via console mode 'r'
    NOTE: This is a large security hole, allowing people to see passwords.
    This is now restricted to +n users only. Please choose your owners with
    care.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set debug-output 0
    This setting allows you the logging of all information sent to a server,
    via console mode 'v'
    NOTE: This is a large security hole, allowing people to see passwords.
    This is now restricted to +n users only. Please choose your owners with
    care.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set strict-host 0
    Set this to 1 if you don't want your the bot to strip a leading '~'
    on user@hosts
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set quiet-reject 1
    This setting makes the bot squelch the error message when rejecting a DCC
    CHAT or SEND. Normally it tells the DCC user that the CHAT or SEND has
    been rejected because they don't have access.
    Please note, sometimes IRC server operators detect bots that way.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set flood-msg 5:60

     recognized as a flood. Not specifying or using number = 0
     will not check against ctcp floods


set answer-ctcp 3
    Set how many ctcps should be answered at once


set lowercase-ctcp 0
    If you want your bot to answer lower case ctcp request (non rfc
    compliant) set this setting to 1.
    Please note: mIRAC will do this, most other clients will not
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set trigger-on-ignore 0
    If you want eggdrop to trigger binds for ignored users, set this to 1

set double-help 0
    Allow a msg being twice in help queue?
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.

set use-penalties 1 (default on net-type 1)
    This enables eggdrop's penalty calculation. Every command eggdrop sends to
    the irc server raises it's penatly points. If eggdrop reaches a server limit,
    it gets disconnected with "excess flood" message. Eggdrop is able to count
    internal those penalty points, too and take measures against excess flooding.
    Note: it's highly adviced to turn this on!


set use-lagcheck 1
    Lag check makes the bot check after every command send to the server if it's
    lagging or not. If it is, queues are stopped to prevent server flooding.
    There are three different options for this setting:
     0 = turn it off
     1 = enable lag check and optimize kicks
     2 = trace nick changes and channel parts and change the queues respectively.
    Please note, this lagcheck has been optimized for IRCNET at the moment,
    but it should work for other networks, too. If you experience any
    problems on other nets eggdrop still excess floods) mail the eggdrop
    development crew please.
    Valid settings are 0-2



set optimize-kicks 1
    Optimize kicks optimizes kick queue. It also traces nick changes and parts in
    channel and changes the kick queue respectively.
    There are three different options for this setting:
     0 = turn it off
     1 = optimize kick queue by sumarizing kicks.
     2 = trace nick changes and channel parts and change the queue respectively. For
         example, bot wont try to kick users who have already parted the channel.
    Please note, this setting is not needed if you set 'use-lagcheck' to 1.
    Valid settings are 0-2


These were the core irc module settings. There are more settings for
'net-type' 5.

Attention: Use this settings *only* if you set 'net-type' to 5!

set check-mode-r 1
    This settings defines how umode +r is understood by eggdrop. Some
    networks use +r to mean a restricted connection. If this is your
    case, and you want your bot to leave restricted servers and jump
    to the next one on his server list, then set it to 1.
    Please note, this setting is automatically set to 0 for net-type 0/2/3/4,
    and set to 1 for net-type 1.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set nick-len 9
    This setting enables you to use different nick lengths then the ircd's
