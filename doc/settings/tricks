tweaking tips for your config file

As your botnet grows bigger and you have to maintain more and more bots
with their config files, you might render those little tweaking tips usefull,
since they can make your life configuring, maintaining and adding of bots
lot's of easier.

well, here we go:

- config file split
  You can export parts of your config file to seperate files. For example, if
  you have several config files which differ from themselfes only by the
  nickname and the used servers, you can export them to an own file and link
  it with the 'source' command, similar to a script.
  The advance of this trick is, that you have to edit / upload only the small
  file instead of the big one. This technique is also usefull if you want to
  maintain always the same channel settings, etc.

- variable usage in the config file
  you can use variables in your config file since it's a plain tcl file. For
  example, you can set 'userfile' and 'chanfile' to "$myvar" and define $myvar
  in the first line by 'set myvar "yourbotname"'. By this way, you can maintain
  your files by changing just one line.
