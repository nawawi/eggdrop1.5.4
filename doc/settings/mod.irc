##### IRC MODULE #####

This module provides basic irc support for your bot.  You have to
load this if you want your bot to come on irc.

Put this line into your eggdrop configuration file file to load irc module:

loadmodule irc


There are also some variables you can to set in your config file:

set bounce-bans 1
    Set this to 1 if you want to bounce all server bans
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set bounce-modes 0
    Set this to 1 if you want to bounce all the server modes
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set max-modes 30
    Set here the global limit for +b/+e/+I modes on your irc server. This
    limit is set to 30 on 2.10 ircd servers.


set max-bans 20
    Set here the maximum number of bans you want eggdrop to put
    in a channel. Eggdrop wont place any more bans if this limit
    is reached.


set kick-fun 0
    Set this to 1 if you want the bot to kick for control character/ctcp
    avalanches to a channel. Remember that if it does, as it won't ban
    them, it can be at the origin of a nice kick-flood.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set ban-fun 0
    Set this to 1 if you want the bot to ban for control character/ctcp
    avalanches to a channel. Can prevent the above described kick-flood,
    but can also fill the banlist.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set learn-users 0
    If you want people to introduce themself to eggdrop via 'hello',
    set this to 1.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set wait-split 600
    Set here the time (in seconds) to wait for someone to return from
    a netsplit (i.e. wasop will expire afterwards).
    Hint: Set this to 1500 on IRCNet, since it's nick delay stops after
          30 minutes.


set wait-info 180
    Set here the time (in seconds) that someone must have been off-channel
    before re-displaying their info


set mode-buf-length 200
    Set this to the maximum number of bytes to send in the arguments
    to mode's sent to the server, most servers default this to 200,
    so it should be sufficient.


set no-chanrec-info 0
    If you are so lame you want the bot to display peoples info lines, even
    when you are too lazy to add their chanrecs to a channel, set this to 1
    *NOTE* This means *every* user with an info line will have their info
    display on EVERY channel they join (provided they have been gone longer
    than wait-info)
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set revenge-mode 1
    This settings defines how the bot should punish bad users when
    revenging.
    There are four possible settings:
     0 for deop
     1 for deop and chattr +d #chan
     2 for deop, chattr +d #chan and kick
     3 for deop, chattr +d #chan, kick and ban.
    Valid settings are 0-3



These were the core irc module settings. There are more settings for
'net-type' 1 and 5. net-type has to be set in the server module config

    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.

    of b,o and v modes with e and I modes. This might be changed in the
    future, so use 1 at the moment for this flag
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


##### IRC MODULE - net-type 5 specific features (other networks) #####

Attention: Use this settings *only* if you set 'net-type' to 5!

set kick-method 1
    If your network supports more users per kick command then 1, you change
    this behaviour here: Set X for x users at once or 0 for all at once


set modes-per-line 3
    Some networks allow you to stack lots of channel modes into one line.
    They're all guaranteed to support at least 3, so that's the default,
    but if you know your network supports more, you may want to adjust
    this value.
    Valid settings are 3-6


set use-354 0
    Set this to 1 if your network uses ircu2.10.01 specific /who requests,
    eggdrop can therefore ask only for exactly what's needed.
    Valid settings are 0 for OFF and 1 ON.


set rfc-compliant 1 (Disabled by default)
    If your network doesn't use rfc 1459 compliant string matching routines,
    turn this to 0. All networks apart from Dalnet comply with rfc 1459, so
    you should only disable it on Dalnet or networks which use Dalnet's code.
