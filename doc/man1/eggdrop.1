.SH NAME
eggdrop \- an IRC robot program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B eggdrop
.RB [ options ]
.RB [ config-file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I eggdrop
is a fully-functional Internet Relay Chat robot program.  It 
is stand-alone, and does not require the 
.I ircII
client.  It currently supports all known IRC nets, including EFnet, 
IRCnet, Dalnet and Undernet.
.PP
By itself, 
.I eggdrop 
does nothing.  It needs a config file (usually named after your bot) 
to tell it how to behave.  The
config file is actually a script written in
.I "enhanced TCL"
(TCL with extra commands and variables defined by eggdrop).  A sample 
TCL config file with describing comments for each option, 
.IR eggdrop.conf.dist , 
is given with the distribution.
.PP
There is
.B extensive
online documentation.  Once you get the bot
running, open a DCC chat with it, and send it a DCC message like:
.IP
/msg =MyBot .help
.SH OPTIONS
.I eggdrop
options include:
.TP
.B \-h
displays a list of command-line options.
.TP
.B \-v
displays the current version of eggdrop, as well as any patches that have
been loaded.
.TP
.B \-n
.I eggdrop
normally automatically moves into the background upon loading.  This
option makes it stay in the foreground and display console entries
to the console terminal.
.TP
.B \-nc
Like
.B \-n
the bot won't move into the background.  However, the console terminal
will display channel status every 10 seconds, instead of log entries.
.TP
.B \-nt
As above, the bot won't move into the background.  The console terminal
simulates a local DCC chat which never ends (as long as the bot is
running).  The nickname used for the DCC chat is "HQ" (a master).
.TP
.B \-m
The first time you run
.IR eggdrop ,
you need to use the -m option, to
put eggdrop in "userfile creation" mode.  Follow the directions
and it will build a user record database, with you listed as 
an 'owner' (person who runs the bot).
.SH SIGNALS
.I eggdrop
handles the following signals:
.TP
.B SIGCHLD
This signal is ignored by 
.I eggdrop
and can be used to determine whether it's running or not.
.TP
.B SIGTERM
Depending on die-on-sigterm being set to 0 or 1 in the config file, 
.I eggdrop
will save the user file or die.
.TP
.B SIGHUP
Depending on die-on-sighup being set to 0 or 1 in the config file,
.I eggdrop
will rehash or die.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"

The default is ./language
