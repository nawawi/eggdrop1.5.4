  global flags matches vs global flags only, operator is one of & or |
  & implies EXACT match i.e. if you use o&n it will match only global +o AND
  channel +n, whereas | is or, i.e. any will trrigger it eg: Bo|o will
  trigger by a botnet master OR a global op OR a channel op. [beldin]
  THIS WILL BREAK ANY SCRIPT that uses O/M/N in bindings (woohoo ;)
  (OR is the default take note)
* also applies to help/text outputs (someone go through and change these all

  fields for additional user information. [BB]
* New global variable `numversion' containing the numeric source
  version from `version.' [BB]
* New global variable `lastbind' for identifying what bound command
  triggered a tcl routine. [BB]
* If a permanant owner was -mn'ed, the +n would be retained, but that
  owner would not be able to effect .chattr's because he would not have
  a +m himself.  Hence, he could not even +m himself to fix it. [BB]
* .who now reports DCC socket numbers to OWNERs. [BB]
* DCC socket numbers ONCE AGAIN removed from inter-bot note displays. [BB]
* Bug in filesys module when no files-path caused a crash. (added a new 
  call to the filesys module: FILESYS_ISVALID). [BB]

  (eggdrop and *.so's are no longer mv'd, but are -o'd to the base
  source directory for dependancy) [BB]

  server list when servers identify themselves differently. [BB]
* More fun help file grammar changes... Still not done yet. [BB]
* new tcl var: dcc-flood-thr - dcc flood threshold [BB/beldin]
* Removed #define OWNER - always an owner now [BB/beldin]
* tcl_chpass needed 16 byte password buffers [paranorml]
* small change to tcl-commands.doc [beldin]
