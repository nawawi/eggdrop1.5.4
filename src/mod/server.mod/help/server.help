%{help=dump}%{+m}
###  %bdump%b <text>
   dumps the text to the server.  keep in mind that this bot doesn't
   run through ircII, so ircII commands will most likely not work this
   way.  they need to be raw irc codes. read rfc1459 from ftp.internic.net 
   for more help.
%{help=jump}%{+m}
###  %bjump%b [server [port]]
   makes the bot jump to another server.  if you don't specify a
   server, it will jump to the next server in its internal list (see
   %b'help servers'%b).  if you specify a server, it will jump to that
   server (default port is 6667), and if that server is not in the
   internal list already, it will add it.  jumping servers ALWAYS
   makes the bot lose ops! be careful!
%{help=clearqueue}%{+m}
###  %bclearqueue%b <queue>
   removes all msgs from the specified queue (mode/server/help/all)
%{help=servers}%{+o|o}
###  %bservers%b
   lists the servers that the bot has in its server list.  this is
   the list it rotates through when changing servers.  it starts
   with a static list which it loads from its config-file when the
   bot is booted up.  after that, you can add servers with the
   %b'.jump'%b command.  the server list will indicate which server the
   bot is currently on.
