   make it only visible within the bot. Bantime has to be expressed
   in days, hours and minutes.

### %b-chan%b <channel>
     This removes ALL information about a channel from the bot. It's not
     made permanent unless a channel-file has been defined in the user
     file, in which case it's saved each time the usefile is, or by using
     .chansave.
     
     %f*** IMPORTANT ***%f
     
     This erases ALL information about the channel, including channel
     settings and channel records for users--%bEVERYTHING%b.
     
     %bDO NOT%b use it to have the bot temporarily leave a channel.  This
     command is for abandoning a channel (e.g. the channel will have
     to be redefined and all user flags for that channel will have to
     be redone. 

     Even if you don't have chanfile defined, it will still erase
     all the channel records for users on the next userfile save.

%{help=bans}%{+o|o}
###  %bbans%b [[channel] wildcard]
###  %bbans%b all
   Shows you a list of the global bans active on the current channel,
   and the list of channel-specific bans, as well as any bans that
   are on the channel but weren't placed by the bot.

   Here's a sample entry;
      [ 5] *!*habib@*frys.com (perm)
           paulie: revolving check policy
           Created 15:10
   The number (5) can be used to reference the ban if you wish
   to remove it (see '.-ban').  Next is the actual hostmask being
   banned.  The "(perm)" means that the ban is "permanent": that
   is, it doesn't automatically expire.  If there is an elapsed time
   showing instead, the time displayed is how long the ban has been
   active.  Those kind of bans expire after one hour.  The second line
   of the ban entry is the comment ("revolving check policy" -- it
   would seem that paulie had to stand in line for a while) and who put
   the ban there (paulie).  The last line shows when the ban was added,
   and possibly the last time the ban was activated on the channel (if
   it's different from the creation time).

   Sometimes there will be a "!" or "*" right before the number.  a "!"
   means the ban is in the bot's permban list, but is not currently on
   the channel.  a "*" marks a ban which is NOT in the permban list but
   IS on the channel.

   Af you use 'bans' it will show you only the bans which are
   currently in action on the channel.  If you use 'bans all' it
   will show you every ban in memory (with 'perm-bans' on, these
   are identical).

   If you use 'bans <wildcard>' it will list all the bans (active
   or not) that match against your wildcard.  Consider it a 'bans
   all' list matched against your wildcard.

   The ban list may change according to which channel you're
   currently viewing in the console.  Different bans may be active
   on different channels.  If you specify a channel name, that
   channel will be used instead of your current console channel.

###  %binvites%b [[channel] wildcard]
###  %binvites%b all
   Shows you a list of the global invites active on the current channel,
   and the list of channel-specific invites, as well as any invites that
   are on the channel but weren't placed by the bot.

   Here's a sample entry;
      [ 5] *!*habib@*frys.com (perm)
           paulie: revolving check policy
           Created 15:10
   The number (5) can be used to reference the invite if you wish
   to remove it (see '.-invite').  Next is the actual hostmask being
   invitened.  The "(perm)" means that the invite is "permanent": that
   is, it doesn't automatically expire.  If there is an elapsed time
   showing instead, the time displayed is how long the invite has been
   active.  Those kind of invites expire after one hour.  The second line
   of the invite entry is the comment ("revolving check policy" -- it
   would seem that paulie had to stand in line for a while) and who put
   the invite there (paulie).  The last line shows when the invite was added,
   and possibly the last time the invite was activated on the channel (if
   it's different from the creation time).

   Sometimes there will be a "!" or "*" right before the number.  a "!"
   means the invite is in the bot's perminvite list, but is not currently on
   the channel.  a "*" marks a invite which is NOT in the perminvite list but
   IS on the channel.

   Af you use 'invites' it will show you only the invites which are
   currently in action on the channel.  If you use 'invites all' it
   will show you every invite in memory (with 'perm-invites' on, these
   are identical).

   If you use 'invites <wildcard>' it will list all the invites (active
   or not) that match against your wildcard.  Consider it a 'invites

   as any ban exemptions that are on the channel but weren't placed by
   the bot.

   Here's a sample entry;
      [ 5] *!*habib@*frys.com (perm)

   second line of the ban exemption entry is the comment ("revolving check
   policy" -- it would seem that paulie had to stand in line for a while)
   and who put the ban exemption there (paulie).  The last line shows when
   the ban exemption was added, and possibly the last time the ban exemption
   was activated on the channel (if it's different from the creation time).

%{help=chanload}%{+n|n}
###  %bchanload%b
     Reloads the channel settings from the file defined by the 
     %b"chanfile"%b setting.  This allows you to return to
     a previous setting if you've really messed things up.
See also: %{+n}+chan, -chan,%{+N} chanload, chanset, chaninfo
%{help=chanset}%{+n|n}
###  %bchanset%b <channel> <settings>
     Allows you to change the channel settings for a channel.
     (See %b'.help chaninfo'%b for the settings)
     These are used until the next rehash/chanload/restart,
     and are saved whenever the channel settings are saved.
See also: %{+n}+chan, -chan%{+N} chanload, chanset, chaninfo
%{help=chansave}%{+n|n}
###  %bchansave%b
     Saves the channel settings to the file defined by the %b"chanfile"%b
     setting.  This file is reloaded during rehash and restarting the bot.
     This allows you to change channel modes without having to edit the 
     config file every time.

%{help=chinfo}%{+m|m}
###  %bchinfo%b <user> [channel] [info-line]
   Sets the information line for a user.  This line is shown via /msg
   commands %b'who'%b and %b'whois'%b, and if you have set greet on, it is 
   shown when a user joins the channel.  If the info line begins with a
   '@', then it is "locked", and that user may no longer change it.
   If the channel name is omitted, the default info line is changed.
###  %bchinfo%b <user> [channel] none
   Erases a user's info line.
See also: info
%{help=info}
###  %binfo%b [channel] [info-line]
   sets your info line.  this is shown via /msg commands %b'who'%b and
   %b'whois'%b, and possibly when you join the channel.  if you omit the
   info line, it will just show you what your current info line is.
   if you omit the channel name, your default info line will be
   displayed/changed.  (this is the info line shown for channels
   where you have no specific info line set.)
###  %binfo%b [channel] none
   removes your info line.
%{help=stick}%{+o|o}
###  %bstick%b [ban/exempt/invite] <hostmask OR number>
   makes a ban/exempt/invite "sticky" -- meaning the bot will
   always try to keep it active on the channel, even if the 
   channel is using dynamic bans.  obviously if the channel isn't
   using dynamic bans, this has no effect.

###  %bunstick%b [ban/exempt/invite] <hostmask OR number>
