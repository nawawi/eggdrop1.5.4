%{help=set ignore-time}%{+n}
###  %bset ignore-time%b <#>
   specifies how long (in minutes) a temporary ignore will last
   on the bot before being purged.

see also: ignores, +ignore, set ban-time
%{help=set dcc-flood-thr}%{+n}
###  %bset dcc-flood-thr%b <#>
   This determines the number of messages per second a user can
   send to the botnet before it's considered a flood, and they
   should get booted.
%{help=set save-users-at}%{+n}
###  %bset save-users-at%b <minute>
   tells eggdrop when to save its userfile, which it does once an
   hour.  this number will set the number of minutes after the top
   of the hour to write the userfile -- for example, setting it to
   15 will make the bot write its userfile at 3:15, 4:15, etc.
see also: set switch-logfiles-at
%{help=set hourly-updates}%{+n}
###  %bset hourly-updates%b <#>
   allows you to set the minutes past the hour that the hourly
   event hooks will be called, this effects such things as note
   notfication.
%{help=set switch-logfiles-at}%{+n}
###  %bset switch-logfiles-at%b <military-time>
   tells eggdrop when to switch logfiles, storing away the current
   logfile and starting fresh.  normally this happens at midnight,
   but on some busy systems where many other processes do things
   at midnight, you might want to set this to a different time,
   like 3am.  the time is a number, in military time with no other
   characters, like "300" or "2200".
   (please note that a leading zero will make it think you're
   specifying the time in octal, which is almost certainly not
   what you want.)

%{help=set connect-timeout}%{+n}
###  %bset connect-timeout%b <seconds>
   specifies how long to wait when connecting to a dcc chat, telnet,
   relay, bot link, or anything like that.  if the connect doesn't
   happen after this many seconds, the bot will just give up.
%{help=set reserved-port}%{+n}
###  %bset reserved-port%b <port#>
   names a particular port to send all outgoing DCC file transfers
   through.  if you're behind a firewall, and you can tell your
   firewall software to make a "peephole" on a certain port, you
   would need to set this to make sure that all file transfers
   go through the peephole.  (normally, DCC file transfers grab
   the nearest unused port.)  there are also various other security
   uses for this.

%{help=set require-p}%{+n}
###  %bset require-p%b <0/1>
   specifies whether users with 'o' (global op) also need
   the 'p' flag to join the party line.
%{help=set keep-all-logs}%{+n}
###  %bset keep-all-logs%b <0/1>
   specifies whether to keep logs older than 48 hours or not.  if
   this is set off, at midnight, the current logfile will be re-
   named to "(logfile).yesterday" and a new logfile started.  the
   old "(logfile).yesterday" will be erased.  if this is set on,
   at midnight, the current logfile will be renamed to "(logfile).
   (date)" and a new logfile started.  eventually your directory
   will be full of files like "LameBot.log.14Jul94".
%{help=set open-telnets}%{+n}
###  %bset open-telnets%b <0/1>
   specifies whether to accept new users via a telnet connection.
   if set to 0, the bot will only accept telnet connections from
   people who already have user records.  if set to 1, someone can
   enter "NEW" after telnetting to the bot, and create a new user
   record.
%{help=set uptime}%{+n}
###  %bset uptime%b
   this read-only variable returns the time the bot started running
   in unixtime.
%{help=set console}%{+n}
###  %bset console%b <console-flags>
   specifies the default console mode for masters and ops when
   they first get on the dcc chat connection with the bot.  for
   more info about console flags, see %b'console'%b.
%{help=set default-flags}%{+n}
###  %bset default-flags%b <flags>
   specifies the flags to give to a user when they first
   introduce themselves to the bot with %b/MSG HELLO%b or via telnet.
   obviously this has no effect if you have %b'learn-users'%b and
   %b'open-telnets'%b turned off.
   for a list of the flags, see %b'whois'%b.
%{help=set log-time}%{+n}
###  %bset log-time%b <0/1>
   specifies whether or not to time-stamp all log entries.
%{help=set numversion}%{+n}
###  %bset numversion%b
   This read-only variable returns the current version in numeric
   form:  abbccdd, where a = major version, bb = minor version,
   cc = release version, dd = patch version,
   so version 1.4.0+pl5 would be 1040005
%{help=set die-on-sighup}%{+n}
###  %bset die-on-sighup%b 0/1
   This config-file-only variable determines whether the bot will
   die on receiving a HUP signal, or just rehash.
%{help=set die-on-sigterm}%{+n}
###  %bset die-on-sigterm%b 0/1
   This config-file-only variable determines whether the bot will
   die on receiving a TERM signal, or just save the userfile.
%{help=set remote-boots}%{+n}
###  %bset remote-boots%b 0/1
   This config-file-only variable has 3 settings, 0 means dont allow
   anyone else to boot people of your bot, 1 means allow people on
   other sharebots to boot people of you bot, 2 means allow any bot
   to boot people of your bot.
%{help=set max-dcc}%{+n}
###  %bset max-dcc%b <#>
   This sets the maximum number of dcc users you can have on the bot
   at any one time, this value can only ever be increased, and it
   always helps to have a few spare.
%{help=set max-logs}%{+n}
###  %bset max-logs%b <#>
   This sets the maximum number of log files you can have at any one
   time, this value can only ever be increase, and it always helps
   to have a few spare.
%{help=set enable-simul}%{+n}
###  %bset enable-simul%b 0/1
   This questionable setting enables the dccsimul command which
   allows tcl to simulate a user typing a command, some scripts
   require it.
%{help=set protect-telnet}%{+n}
###  %bset protect-telnet%b 0/1
   This setting, when enabled, only allows telnet connections from
   know user@host's. This prevents to some degree botscans.
   This also negates the use of open-telnet's since a new user
   can't even get to a prompt.
%{help=set ident-timeout}%{+n}
###  %bset ident-timeout%b <#>
   Sets the number of seconds to wait before discarding an ident
   attempt for a connectiong user.
%{help=set share-unlinks}%{+n}
###  %bset share-unlinks%b 0/1
   If you wish to prevent other bots/users from unlinking a sharebot
   you are connected to, set this value to 1.
%{help=set allow-dk-cmds}%{+n}
###  %bset allow-dk-cmds%b 0/1
   Some say +d/+k users should be able to use all the any-user commands,
   Some say they shouldn't, WHO CARES :) this little setting lets you
   decide for yourself, I'm too weak to decide for you.
%{help=set userfile-perm}%{+n}
###  %bset userfile-perm%b <#>
   Specifies what permissions the user, channel and notes
   files should be set to.  The octal values are the same
   as for the chmod system command.  Most users will want
   to leave the permissions set to %b0600%b, to ensure maximum
   security.
