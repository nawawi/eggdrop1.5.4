%{help=set botnet-nick}%{+n}
###  %bset botnet-nick%b <nickname>
   sets a name to use on the botnet that's different from the
   nickname used on IRC.  if not set, this will default to being
   the same as 'nick'. if the server module is not loaded and
   you don't set a botnet-nick the bot will not start

see also: set nick, set altnick (server module variables)
%{help=set userfile}%{+n}
###  %bset userfile%b <filename>
   specifies the filename where eggdrop should store user
   records.  you normally don't want to change this once you
   have started using the bot.
%{help=set motd}%{+n}
###  %bset motd%b <filename>
   specifies the "Message Of The Day" file.  this should be a
   text file.  it will be displayed to users as they enter a
   dcc chat session with the bot (so it shouldn't be TOO long).
   there are a few %%-variables you can insert into the motd,
   which will be interpreted by eggdrop:
      %%b   display bold
      %%v   display inverse
      %%_   display underline
      %%f   display flashing via telnet, bold underline via irc
      %%B   bot's nickname (ie, "%B")
      %%V   current eggdrop version (ie, "%V")
      %%E   long form of %%V (ie, "%E")
      %%C   channels the bot is on (ie, "%C")
      %%A   whatever is set in 'admin' (see 'set admin')
      %%T   the current time (ie, "%T")
      %%N   the current user's nickname (ie, "%N")
      %%U   the current operating system the bot is on
      %%%%   a percent sign ("%%")
   you can also encode messages which can only be read by people
   with certain flags:
      %%{+m}Only masters would see this.%%{-}
      %%{+1}Only people with user flag #1 see this.%%{-}
      %%{+b}This is only displayed to users doing a remote '.motd'
      from another bot.%%{-}
      %%{+|m}Only channel masters would see this.%%{-}
   Other extended %% commands are:
      %%{cols=N}     start splitting output into N columns
      %%{cols=N/W}   same, but use a screen width of W
      %%{end}        end columnated or restricted (ie %%{+m}) block
      %%{centre}     center the following text (70 columns)
%{help=set admin}%{+n}
###  %bset admin%b <admin-info>
   specifies the admin info for your bot.  it's just human-
   readable text that is displayed every once in a while.  it
   shouldn't be very long (no more than about 60 characters)
   and ought to say who's running the bot, and maybe an email
   address too.  here's an example:
      set admin "Jace the Happy <jason@mtu.edu>"
%{help=set help-path}%{+n}
###  %bset help-path%b <path>
   specifies the path to the help/ directory for the bot.  if
   you can read this, it was probably set right. :)
%{help=set temp-path}%{+n}
###  %bset temp-path%b <path>
   specifies a temporary directory where eggdrop can store
   files for a short period of time.  right now this is used
   to hold copies of files while people dcc-transfer them,
   so that changes made to the file in the file transfer area
   won't affect the dcc-get.  under all normal circumstances,
   this ought to be set to "/tmp".
%{help=set mod-path}%{+n}
###  %bset mod-path%b <path>
   Specifies the path to the modules directory for the bot, modules
   are chunks of C code that can be loaded & unloaded from the bot.
   if you're reading this, it's highly likely you've got this
   setup correctly, the default modules/ is usually sufficient.
%{help=set notify-newusers}%{+n}
###  %bset notify-newusers%b <nickname-list>
   specifies who to inform when the bot gets introduced to
   new users via the %b/MSG HELLO%b command.  obviously this has
   no effect unless the %b/MSG HELLO%b command is activated.
   the bot will send a note (see %b'note'%b) to each user listed
   in notify-newusers.  this can be just one nick:
      set notify-newusers "Robey"
   or several, separated by commas:
      set notify-newusers "Guy, Eden@Priscilla"
   the default is "HQ" which stands for head quarters.
   if you don't want anyone to be informed, just leave it blank.
%{help=set owner}%{+n}
###  %bset owner%b <nickname-list>
   specifies the user(s) who are to ALWAYS be bot owners.  it
   is impossible to remove the +n flag from anyone listed here.
   if the bot was compiled with the owner flag turned off, this
   variable has no significance.
%{help=set my-hostname}%{+n}
###  %bset my-hostname%b <hostname>
   overrides the network DNS name used by the bot to identify
   itself on servers, etc.  this is only useful if your machine
   has multiple hostnames and you would like the bot to use a
   particular one, or if the bot has trouble detecting your
   hostname automatically.

see also: set my-ip
%{help=set my-ip}%{+n}
###  %bset my-ip%b <ip-address>
   overrides the network IP used by the bot to identify itself
   over dcc connections.  this is really only useful if your
   machine has multiple IPs and you would like the bot to use
   a particular one, or if the bot has trouble detecing your
   IP automatically.

see also: set my-hostname
%{help=set nat-ip}%{+n}
###  %bset nat-ip%b <ip-address>
   if you are behind a NAT firewall, or using IP masquerading, you
   may have trouble with the bot dcc send'ing files to people, set
   this to you firewalls IP address to get around this problem.
%{help=set network}%{+n}
###  %bset network%b <net-name>
   names the IRC network you're connected to.  (obviously,
   this only matters if the bot is on IRC.)  it's just
   human-readable text that's shared with other bots on
   your botnet.
%{help=set whois-fields}%{+n}
###  %bset whois-fields%b <field-list>
   tells the bot what "xtra" fields to display in a %b'.whois'%b or
   %b'.match'%b command.  the "xtra" fields are normally set by
   scripts using 'user-get' or 'user-set' and contain extra info
   about a user.  an example is:
      set whois-fields "url pet"
   which will make %b'.whois'%b and %b'.match'%b display the values for
   'url' and 'pet' that have been set by scripts.
%{help=set username}%{+n}
###  %bset username%b <username>
   specifies the username the bot will try to use on IRC.  if
   your machine is running ident, this won't work, and the bot
   will show up as the user who started up the bot.
see also: set realname
%{help=set version}%{+n}
### %bset version%b
   this read-only variable returns the current version of the bot
   in the form v1.4.0+<lastpatch> <versionnumber> <patch list>.
%{help=set filewall}%{+n}
###  %bset firewall%b <host:port>
   specifies your telnet proxy server if you're behind a firewall.
   leave this blank if you have a normal (direct) net connection.
   if set, this should contain the host and port of your socks v4
   proxy server.  it may start with a '!' if you're on a sun telnet
   passthru server (this barely works, if at all -- consider using
   socks).

see also: set reserved-port
%{help=set telnet-flood}%{+n}
###  %bset telnet-flood <times:seconds>%b
   this setting will cause the bot to ignore any futher telnets it
   receives from any given host that connects any more than the
   given times in the given number of seconds
